At the beginning you are told you are going to Neptune. You will be thrown off course and have to complete levels and challenges to get to the end. Maybe you will never reach the planet, maybe you will discover a new one, and maybe you will die. Each level is different. There will be choices. With each choice, you will access more levels. One choice could kill you, another could take you to asteroid field, a different choice could take you to a space snake that will eat you unless you answer it's riddles.

A bunch of mini games to get through when you get to the end of a game you move onto another or are faced with a choice, each choice can take you to different levels or kill you.

 Anything could kill you, there will possibly be second chances and opportunities to collect health. There will also be a secret level, if you complete it you will either unlock something or get straight to the planet you want to get to.

You basically are just trying to survive/get to the planet of your choosing. Another thing is at the beginning you will get to choose the colors of your spaceship.
You can move in all different directions, but this can vary depending on the level(Your movement might be restricted to just side to side)
Some of the objects in this game are the spaceship, which you are in. There are also asteroids, aliens, and other objects that might kill you
